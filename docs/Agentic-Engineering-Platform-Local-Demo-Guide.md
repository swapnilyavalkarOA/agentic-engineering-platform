# Agentic Engineering Platform: Complete Local Setup & Demo Guide (macOS)

## Can You Implement This Project on Mac M4?
Yes, you can implement the entire Agentic Engineering Platform as a proof of concept (POC) on your Mac M4 laptop. Most tools listed are free or offer free tiers for individual use and can be installed on macOS. Some enterprise features (Aha!, Harness, Claude) may require trial accounts or limited access, but all core functionality for a demo is achievable locally.

- **Aha!:** Free trial available, web-based
- **Confluence:** Free tier, web-based
- **Jira:** Free tier, web-based
- **Figma:** Free tier, web-based
- **Claude (AI):** Free trial or limited access via Anthropic, web/API
- **Cucumber:** Free, install via npm
- **Playwright:** Free, install via npm
- **Harness:** Free tier, web-based
- **GitHub Actions:** Free for public repos, included with GitHub
- **Terraform:** Free, install via Homebrew
- **Grafana:** Free, install via Homebrew
- **Maker-Checker:** Custom or open-source, can be implemented locally

## Complete Setup & Installation Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- Update macOS and install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
  ```sh
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```
- Install Node.js and npm:
  ```sh
  brew install node
  ```

### 2. GitHub
- Sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Install Git:
  ```sh
  brew install git
  ```
- Configure Git:
  ```sh
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  ```
- Create a new repository for your project.

### 3. Aha!, Confluence, Jira, Figma
- Sign up for free trials or accounts:
  - [Aha!](https://www.aha.io/)
  - [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)
  - [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
  - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- Set up workspaces/projects and invite collaborators as needed.

### 4. Claude (AI)
- Request access or sign up for a free trial at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)
- Use the web interface or API for requirements analysis and code review.

### 5. Cucumber & Playwright (Automated Testing)
- In your project directory:
  ```sh
  npm init -y
  npm install --save-dev cucumber playwright
  npx playwright install
  ```
- Add sample feature files and Playwright test scripts.

### 6. Harness & GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Sign up for [Harness](https://harness.io/) and connect your GitHub repo.
- Add workflow YAML files to `.github/workflows/` for GitHub Actions automation.

### 7. Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- Install Terraform:
  ```sh
  brew tap hashicorp/tap
  brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
  ```
- Create sample `.tf` files and run:
  ```sh
  terraform init
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

### 8. Grafana (Observability)
- Install Grafana:
  ```sh
  brew install grafana
  ```
- Start Grafana:
  ```sh
  brew services start grafana
  ```
- Access Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and configure dashboards.

### 9. Maker-Checker (AI Code Validation)
- Implement a simple maker-checker workflow using GitHub pull requests and code review assignments.
- Optionally, use open-source tools or scripts for automated checks.

## How to Use & Demo the Project
1. **Requirements & Design:**
   - Create user stories in Jira, document in Confluence, design in Figma.
   - Use Claude for AI-powered analysis and refinement.
2. **Development:**
   - Clone your GitHub repo, scaffold code, and commit changes.
   - Write tests using Cucumber and Playwright.
3. **CI/CD & Automation:**
   - Push code to GitHub, trigger GitHub Actions and Harness pipelines.
   - Use Terraform for infrastructure setup (local or cloud demo).
4. **Testing:**
   - Run automated tests locally:
     ```sh
     npx cucumber-js
     npx playwright test
     ```
   - Review results and logs.
5. **Observability:**
   - Send logs/metrics to Grafana and visualize dashboards.
6. **Maker-Checker:**
   - Submit pull requests, assign reviewers, and validate code changes.

## How to Ensure Everything Works
- Verify all tools are installed and accessible (run `git --version`, `terraform --version`, `grafana-server -v`, etc.)
- Run sample tests and check results in terminal and dashboards.
- Confirm CI/CD pipelines execute on code push.
- Validate infrastructure changes with Terraform.
- Review dashboards in Grafana for metrics/logs.
- Use AI (Claude) for requirements/code review and confirm feedback.

## How to Test the Project Locally
- Run all automated tests:
  ```sh
  npx cucumber-js
  npx playwright test
  ```
- Push code and verify CI/CD runs (GitHub Actions/Harness).
- Access Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and check dashboards.
- Review pull requests and code reviews for maker-checker validation.
- Document findings and demo results for management.

This guide enables you to set up, implement, and demo the Agentic Engineering Platform locally on your Mac M4 laptop, using free or trial versions of all required tools. For a successful management demo, prepare sample workflows, tests, dashboards, and code reviews to showcase the platformâ€™s capabilities end-to-end.
